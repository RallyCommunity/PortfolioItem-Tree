My Portfolio Explorer
=========================

## Overview
This app will allow you to select a type, then an item in your scope with that type and then it will be a tree of the child artifacts.

If you hover over a particular dot, it will give you a 'rallycard' style pop-up. If you click on the dot, it gives you that card and then a list of the children associated with it. This works for all levels of portfolio item, so for features, 
you will see the child user stories
